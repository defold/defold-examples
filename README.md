# Defold examples

Welcome to the Defold examples repo. Here you find a variety of Defold projects that you can use for study or as a base for your own work. If you want to scavenge them for assets that's fine too.

## How am I allowed to use these assets?

Refer to [LICENSE.txt](/LICENSE.txt)

## How do I include the assets in my projects?

If you are not comfortable using Git, you can download any of the examples separately in a
zip archive.

* Create a new project in Defold and open it in the editor
* Right-click "game.project" in the *Project Explorer* and select *Show in Finder* (Mac) or *Show in Explorer* (PC)
* Download and unpack the examples archive you want
* Drag the contents of the archive to the location of the new project in the Finder/Explorer and replace the files in the project
* The editor will pick up the new files and you are ready to go

Alternatively you can add a project as a library dependency in a project. Add the zip url to the
"dependencies" in the *project* section in "game.project".

If you have any questions about these examples, please don't hesitate to visit [the Defold forum](http://forum.defold.com).
